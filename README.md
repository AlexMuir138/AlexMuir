# Hello all ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Muir and I graduated with a Bachelors in Communications with a Media Emphasis. So I know how to talk to people and how to manage conflict as well as how to shoot and edit video. I used to work in the film industry professionally and I plan to learn enough in software development to manage my own content as well as help anyone who might need a developer. I was born and raised in Boise, Idaho and hopefully I will be able to take my skills anywhere.
